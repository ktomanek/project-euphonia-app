# Project Euphonia App

This repository provides an open-source toolkit to build personalized speech recognition solutions, stemming from the broader [Project Euphonia](https://sites.research.google/euphonia/about/) initiative started by Google in 2019. This specific iteration focuses on enabling improved speech-to-text transcription, particularly for individuals with non-standard speech.

## Intended Use

Project Euphonia App is a set of open-source toolkits intended for use by developers to create and customize speech recognition solutions. It provides tools and documentation for collecting speech data, fine-tuning open-source Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, and deploying those models for speech-to-text transcription.The open-source toolkits, in its original form, is not intended to be used without modification for the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or medical condition. Developers are solely responsible for making substantial changes to Project Euphonia’s open-source toolkits and for ensuring that any applications they create comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those related to medical devices.

### Indications for Use

Project Euphonia’s open-source toolkits is intended to provide developers with the capability to:

- Collect volunteered speech data using a customizable mobile application.
- Fine-tune open-source Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models using provided training recipes and infrastructure.
- Deploy trained ASR models for speech-to-text transcription.
- Create accessibility solutions and other applications that leverage customized speech recognition technology.

### Toolkit Description

Project Euphonia’s open-source toolkits are designed to facilitate the creation of customized speech recognition solutions. The toolkits consists of:

- A **Flutter-based mobile application** for recording speech data and associating it with text phrases. The application stores data in a Firebase Storage instance controlled by the developer.
- **Google Colab notebooks** providing example code and documentation for fine-tuning open-source Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. The notebooks will help inform developers on the following topics: data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation.
- Example code for deploying a **web service** that performs speech-to-text transcription using the fine-tuned ASR models. The web service can be deployed to cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Run.

## Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/project-euphonia-app
cd project-euphonia-app
```

### Flutter-based mobile application

This component consists of a **Flutter-based mobile application**. The application consists on 2 main section:

- a section that allows users to record phrases in their own voice.
- a section to transcribe user speech into text using the trained model.

The application comes with a set of 100 default phrases located under `assets/phrases.txt`. You can customize or add more phrases. You can, for example, create training phrases for different languages. For reference, in the folder you can find `assets/phrases_it.txt` file with 100 Italian phrases you can use to update the `assets/phrases.txt` file.

Please create a list of 100 short English phrases such that they have good distribution of all phonemes and their allophones, try to keep the length of each phrase less than 140. Please make sure none of the words in the list are repeated more than thrice. All the phrases don't need to be a valid sentence either, the important task is to ensure coverage over all phonemes and maintain a good distribution of allophones. Please don't add numbering at the beginning of the list.

The recorded speech data is stored in a **Firebase Storage** instance created and controlled by you.

#### Prerequisites

The application requires a [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage). Please follow the following steps:

- Create a project from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [Create firebase storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start) (Note: not "database", it needs to be "storage").
- Configure security rules as public. NOTE: This makes your files accessible by anyone. Consider adding autentication to secure your data.

Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) 2023.3.1 (Jellyfish) or later to debug and compile Java or Kotlin code for Android. Flutter requires the full version of Android Studio.

Install the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). When you run the current version of `flutter doctor`, it might list a different version of one of these packages. If it does, install the version it recommends.

### Installation

- Run `firebase login`
- Run `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
- Configure Flutter project running `flutterfire configure --project=<project-id>`

For Android app use Android studio or run `flutter build apk` and `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` to install the app on the phone.
For iOS: Run `cd ios` and `run pod install`. Make sure mobile-provisioning profiles are present to install the app on-device.

### Train model

This component consists of a Google Colab notebook to run the training. The Notebook will train ASR an open source model to recognize the speech of the user that recorded the training phrases.

Open the notebook in the [training_colabs](https://github.com/google/project-euphonia-app/tree/main/training_colabs) and follow the steps.

### Web service that performs speech-to-text

This component consist of a simple web application to serve the model trained in the previous step. The app is containerized and can be run in Google Cloud Run.

#### Deploy

Copy the trained model (e.g. `pytorch_model.bin`) into the `api/custom_tiny_whisper_model/` folder. Place custom tiny whisper model in the custom_tiny_whisper_model directory as pytorch_model.bin.

Deploy the web app into Google Cloud Run following steps reported in the [app README](api/).

## Usage

Following all [Setup](#setup) steps you installed the Project Euphonia App on your smartphone and the api on Google Cloud Run. You can now set the URL of the Google Cloud Run instance in the app Settings and start transcribing your speech.

## Localization (Internationalization)

This application supports localization, allowing it to be translated into different languages.

To contribute a new localization for the app, please follow these steps:

**Create a new ARB file:** Inside the `/lib/l10n` directory, create a new file named according to the following pattern: `app_COUNTRY_CODE.arb`.
Replace `COUNTRY_CODE` with the appropriate two-letter ISO 639-1 language code (in lowercase). For example:

- For Italian, the file name would be `app_it.arb`.
- For French, the file name would be `app_fr.arb`.
- And so on.

**Add translations:** Open the newly created `.arb` file and add your translations in the standard ARB (Application Resource Bundle) format. This is a JSON-based format where keys represent the identifiers of your text strings and values are their translations in the target language.

```json
{
    "appTitle": "Project Euphonia",
    "recordButtonTitle": "Registra"
}
```

**Contribute your changes:** Once you have added the translations, add the file to the repository following our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for helping to make our app accessible to a wider audience!


## Local Transcription

The "Local" tab uses a local moonshine model provided with [sherpa_onnx](https://pub.dev/packages/sherpa_onnx) library to perform
on-device transcription. To add supported model, download `sherpa-onnx-moonshine-tiny-en-int8.tar.bz2` from [sherpa asr models](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/tag/asr-models)
and move the unzipped files under `assets/moonshine-tiny/` directory.
